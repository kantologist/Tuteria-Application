## Tuteria Interview Process

This repo is to test familiarity with framework and processes used at Tuteria.
The goal is to get this repository functional by figuring out the dependencies used and 
getting the project functional. You don't have to worry about the ui, just ensure the project can be started up.

**These are the steps to be taking**

1. make a fork of the repository to your github account
2. Fix your fork. here are the things that would determine if your fork is fixed

    1. You have a `requirements.txt` of the dependencies used by the project (_You are free to use any thirdparty libray you like to make life easy for you._)
    2. You have successfully organized the folder structure of the repo to match modern web development in **django**
    3. Starting up the project should successfully display a functional home page.(_Do no worry to much about the css but getting basic styling to work is a plus_)
    4. When you are through, issuing a PR back to the main repo.

**Things to take not of when submitting your PR**
1. Indicate your full name in the PR.

**Bonus points**

1. Add a `.gitignore` file to your repo and ensure only files that need to be in the repo are there (_No `.pyc` in the repo._)
2. Applying **pep8** style guide in all the files you edit.
3. Clear and useful commit messages.

### Good luck
